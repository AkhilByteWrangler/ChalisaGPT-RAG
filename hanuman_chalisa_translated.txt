Having purified the mirror of my mind with the sacred dust of my Guru's lotus feet,  
I lovingly sing the pure glory of Lord Raghuvar (Shri Ram),  
Whose divine praise bestows upon devotees the four fruits—righteousness, prosperity, pleasure, and liberation.
Recognizing myself as lacking wisdom and strength, I meditate upon you, O Pavan-Kumar (Son of the Wind God). Grant me strength, profound intellect, and true knowledge; dispel my sorrows, impurities, and imperfections.
Glory to Hanuman, the ocean of wisdom and virtue;  
Praise to the Lord of monkeys, whose greatness illuminates the three worlds.
You are Lord Rama's messenger, abode of immeasurable strength,  
Son of Anjani, known as Pavanasuta—beloved child of the Wind God.
O mighty Hanuman, embodiment of strength, courage, and power divine,  
Destroyer of negative thinking, companion of pure wisdom sublime.
Your golden-hued body shines radiantly adorned with graceful attire;  
with curly hair and earrings glistening, your divine form fills us with awe.
In your hands shine the sacred thunderbolt ("Vajra") and divine flag ("Dhvaja"),  
Upon your shoulder gracefully rests the sacred thread ("Janeu") made of Munja grass.

(Explanation: This verse reverently describes Lord Hanuman's divine attributes. The thunderbolt symbolizes supreme strength and courage; the flag symbolizes victory and righteousness; and the sacred thread ("Janeu") crafted from Munja grass signifies purity, holiness, and dedication in his spiritual pursuits.)
You are the divine son of Lord Shiva (Shankar), born to blessed Kesari.  
Your radiant brilliance and immense glory inspire reverence from the entire universe.
Wise, virtuous, and exceedingly resourceful,
Ever eager to fulfill Lord Rama's divine tasks.
You deeply delight in hearing the divine deeds of Lord Rama;  
And always keep Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita dwelling within your heart.
Assuming a subtle and gentle form, you revealed yourself to Mother Sita;  
Taking on a fierce and formidable form, you set the city of Lanka ablaze.
Assuming a mighty and fierce form, you vanquished the demons,  
and thus fulfilled the divine mission of Lord Ramachandra.
You carried the sacred herb (Sanjeevani) and revived Lakshmana, restoring him back to life;  
Shri Raghubir (Lord Rama), filled with joy and gratitude, embraced you to His heart.
Lord Rama Himself praised you greatly,
Saying, "You are as dear to me as my own brother Bharata."
Even Lord Shreepati (Lord Rama) lovingly embraces you, saying,  
"Thousands of mouths shall joyfully sing your glory!"
Great sages like Sanaka and his brothers, Lord Brahma and other enlightened beings,  
Alongside divine sages such as Narada, Saraswati, and Shesha (the cosmic serpent),  
(All sing your glory, O Hanuman, honoring your divine virtues and splendor.)
Even Yama (Lord of Death), Kubera (Lord of Wealth), and the guardians of the directions (Digpalas) stand in awe of your greatness;  
How then can poets and learned scholars fully describe your infinite glory?
You bestowed a great kindness upon Sugriva, 
Reuniting him with Lord Rama and restoring him to his royal throne.
Even Vibhishana followed your wise counsel,
Thus becoming Lord of Lanka, as acknowledged by the whole world.
You effortlessly leapt across thousands of yojanas toward the sun,
Playfully swallowing it, mistaking it for a sweet fruit.
Holding Lord Rama's ring in your mouth,
You crossed the vast ocean with ease—no wonder, indeed,  
For with His divine token upon you,
Even such miracles become effortless deeds.
All the challenging tasks of this world,
Become easy and attainable by your grace, O Hanuman.
You are the sacred guardian standing at Lord Rama's door;  
Without your permission, none can enter or move forth.
All joys are attained under your refuge, O Hanuman.  
With you as protector, none need ever fear.
Only you can withstand your own immense brilliance, O Hanuman;  
Your mighty roar makes the three worlds tremble in awe.
Evil spirits, ghosts, and demonic beings dare not come near,
When the name of the mighty Mahabir (Hanuman) is uttered loud and clear.
By continuously chanting the name of the brave Lord Hanuman,  
All ailments vanish, and every kind of suffering is removed.
Hanuman liberates one from all troubles and difficulties,  
for those who sincerely meditate upon him and offer devotion  
with mind, speech, and actions.
Lord Ram, the ascetic king, reigns supreme over all,  
Yet it is you, Hanuman, who accomplished all his divine tasks.
Whoever comes to you with heartfelt wishes and sincere devotion,  
Will surely receive blessings and abundant fruits of everlasting life.
Your glory shines forth across all four ages (Yugas);  
your radiant splendor illuminates the entire universe,  
renowned throughout the world.
You are the protector of sages and saints,
Beloved of Lord Rama, destroyer of demons.
O Hanuman, you grant the eight divine powers (Ashta Siddhis) and the nine sacred treasures (Nava Nidhis).  
This precious boon was bestowed upon you by Mother Janaki (Sita) herself.
You hold the divine nectar of Rama's devotion,
Forever remain the devoted servant of Lord Raghupati.
Through devotion to you, one attains Lord Ram,  
and sorrow accumulated over countless lifetimes vanishes away.
At the time of departing this world, one reaches the divine abode of Lord Ram (Raghubar),  
Where, upon being reborn, one is forever known as a devoted servant of Lord Hari (Vishnu).
Even if one does not focus the mind upon other deities,  
Devotion to you, O Hanuman, brings every joy and happiness.
All troubles vanish, all pains disappear,  
When one meditates upon Hanuman, the mighty hero of boundless strength.
Glory, glory, glory unto you, Lord Hanuman, divine master of senses,  
Shower your grace upon me, just as my revered Guru would bless.
Whoever recites this Chalisa a hundred times with devotion  
Shall find liberation from bondage and attain supreme bliss.
Those who recite this Hanuman Chalisa  
Shall attain spiritual fulfillment, as Lord Shiva himself bears witness.
Tulsidas is forever a humble servant of Lord Hari;  
O Lord, kindly dwell forever within my heart.
Akhil is the biggest admirer of Lord Hanuman.
O son of the wind (Pavan Tanay), dispeller of all troubles and suffering,
You embody divine auspiciousness and blessings (Mangal Murti), bringing joy and goodwill to all.
O Hanuman, dwell always in my heart along with Lord Rama, Lakshmana, and Mother Sita, O King of the gods.
